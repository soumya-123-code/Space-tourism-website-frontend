## Overview

### The Challenge

Engage in the timeless game of Rock Paper Scissors with a modern, responsive design. Play against the computer and see if you can outsmart it!

Users should be able to:

- View an optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Enjoy smooth animations and an engaging user experience

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

All necessary assets are in the `/design` folder. Additionally, the `style-guide.md` file contains useful details such as color palettes and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Developing game logic for Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript
- Enhancing UI with CSS animations and transitions
- Handling user inputs and dynamically generating computer choices

This CSS snippet played a key role in improving my understanding of positioning and transitions:

```css
.game-body__circle-container-paper {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: -6.5rem;
}
.game-body__circle-container-scissors {
    position: absolute;
    right: 0;
    top: -6.5rem;
}
.game-body__circle-container-rock {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    bottom: 6rem;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
}
.game-body__circle-container-paper,
.game-body__circle-container-scissors,
.game-body__circle-container-rock {
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued Development

Through this project, I identified key areas for improvement:

- Mastering CSS Flexbox and Grid for better layouts
- Deepening my knowledge of JavaScript async/await and Fetch API
- Exploring game development concepts further

I aim to refine these skills in future projects to enhance my web development expertise.
